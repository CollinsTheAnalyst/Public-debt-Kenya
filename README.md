## Project Overview
This project delves into Kenya's evolving public debt over the past two decades, from 1999 to the present, and its impact on the nation's economy. The study focuses on both **domestic** and **external debt**, assessing their relationships with key economic indicators such as **GDP growth**, **GDP per capita**, and **debt per capita**. With Python as the primary tool for data analysis, this investigation provides in-depth insights into how Kenya's debt dynamics affect the broader economic landscape.

## Objective
The project aims to:
- Compare **domestic vs external debt** trends, analyzing how each has contributed to the nation's total public debt over time.
- Assess the relationship between **public debt** and critical economic indicators such as **GDP growth**, **GDP per capita**, and **debt per capita**.
- Evaluate the **long-term impact** of public debt on Kenya's economic sustainability, offering insights to inform policy and decision-making.

## Scope
- **Timeframe**: Data from 1999 to the present is analyzed.
- **Data Analysis**: Python is used for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, with a focus on detecting trends and uncovering correlations.
- **Key Economic Metrics**: Total public debt, domestic vs external debt ratios, GDP growth rates, and per capita calculations are all evaluated.

## Data Handling
### Data Sources
- **Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)**: Public debt records, both domestic and external.
- **Macrotrends**: GDP per capita, debt per capita, and GDP growth rate data.
- **World Bank/IMF**: Comparative data on public debt and economic indicators.

### Data Cleaning
- **Format Corrections**: Addressing inconsistent formats and converting numerical values to the correct data type.
- **Missing Values**: Linear interpolation was applied to estimate missing values for some economic indicators.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Duplicate entries were filtered out to ensure data integrity.
- **Outlier Detection**: Outliers were detected and removed where necessary.

## Data Analysis in Python
Key metrics analyzed include:
1. **Trends in Domestic and External Debt Over Time**: Exploring phases such as the early 2000s, 2008 financial crisis, infrastructure developments, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Domestic to External Debt Ratio**: Investigating the evolving ratio from 1999 to the present.
3. **Debt Composition**: Assessing the balance between domestic and external debt.
4. **Yearly GDP Trends**: Comparing nominal and real GDP growth, while also tracking the debt-to-GDP ratio.
5. **GDP Growth vs Debt Growth**: Analyzing the growth trends for both GDP and debt over time.

## Key Findings
- **Balanced Debt Composition**: Kenya maintains a nearly equal split between domestic (48.6%) and external debt (51.4%), which mitigates risks associated with global economic fluctuations.
- **Economic Growth vs. Rising Debt**: While GDP has grown steadily, public debt has outpaced it, particularly post-2013 due to infrastructure projects.
- **Debt-to-GDP Ratio Concerns**: Kenya's debt-to-GDP ratio has risen sharply, reaching **64.8%** by 2022, signaling potential sustainability concerns.

## Conclusion
Kenya's growing public debt, driven by infrastructure investments, poses long-term sustainability challenges. Policymakers must balance developmental needs with prudent debt management to ensure the countryâ€™s economic growth remains stable and sustainable.

## Technologies Used
